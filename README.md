Hello,
I am Kingsuk Basak and this is my first Project on javascript(Web Development).I made this project to make to-do lists projects on internet a little more viable. Here you can make different lists for different work and organize you to-do list. I will be continuously updating this project to it's best as i learn more.
You can also find this project on my Portfolio Website.
